# Berakhot
Berakhot (“Blessings”) is the first tractate of Zeraim (“Seeds”), the first order of the Mishnah, and the only tractate in Zeraim included in the Babylonian Talmud. Its nine chapters discuss the laws of prayers, focusing on the Shema, the Amidah, and blessings, including those recited in the context of eating.
